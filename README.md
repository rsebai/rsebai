#### Hi there, I'm Rajae 👋
  As an AI enthusiast, I am deeply passionate about AI that is designed to positively impact humanity while safeguarding our natural environment. I am especially interested in the Medical Imaging field ⚕️ and I developed a taste for protein ontology with Graphs & NLP. When I'm not reading 📚, I enjoy taking photos 📸.
